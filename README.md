# To Do List

Let's see what you're made of! 

Fork this repo and create your own vanillajs-powered to do list.

Gulp, Browsersync and Gulp Sass have been included in the package. These can be installed by running `npm install` in the command prompt. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) must be installed to use the Node Package Manager. If you have any [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) problems, you may also need to install the packages globally.<br/><br/> Use these tools as you wish or create an environment that works best for you. 

Feel free to create your own component structure and organize your files as you please. There is no right or wrong way to organize your code.

### **When you have completed the project, submit a GitHub pull request back to this repository and notify Tauck Human Resources that you are ready for the application to be reviewed.**
